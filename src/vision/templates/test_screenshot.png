This is a placeholder for a test screenshot.
To properly test the screen recognition, this image should be a screenshot
from the Limbus Company game that contains an "upgrade event" UI element
and text for an item ID and new level.
You can capture one using tools like Greenshot, ShareX, or the built-in
screenshot functionality of your OS.
Make sure the "upgrade_template.png" is a small crop of a distinct
UI element from this test_screenshot.png.
